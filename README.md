# R3LIVE
## A Robust, Real-time, RGB-colored, LiDAR-Inertial-Visual tightly-coupled state Estimation and mapping package


## 1. Introduction
**R3LIVE** is a novel LiDAR-Inertial-Visual sensor fusion framework, which takes advantage of measurement of LiDAR, inertial, and visual sensors to achieve robust and accurate state estimation. R3LIVE is built upon our previous work [R2LIVE](https://github.com/hku-mars/r2live), is contained of two subsystems: the LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and the visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The LIO subsystem ([FAST-LIO](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO)) takes advantage of the measurement from LiDAR and inertial sensors and builds the geometric structure of (i.e. the position of 3D points) global maps. The VIO subsystem utilizes the data of visual-inertial sensors and renders the map's texture (i.e. the color of 3D points). <br>

## 2. What can R3LIVE do?

### 2.1 Strong robustness in various challenging scenarios
R3LIVE is robust enough to work well in various of LiDAR-degenerated scenarios (see following figures): 
<div align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/ziv-lin/r3live_dataset/blob/main/gifs/degenerate_02.gif"  width="48%" />
</div>

And even in simultaneously LiDAR degenerated and visual texture-less environments (see Experiment-1 of our [paper](https://github.com/hku-mars/r3live/blob/master/papers/R3LIVE:%20A%20Robust%2C%20Real-time%2C%20RGB-colored%2C%20LiDAR-Inertial-Visual%20tightly-coupled%20stateEstimation%20and%20mapping%20package.pdf)).

</div>

### 2.2 Real-time RGB maps reconstruction
R3LIVE is able to reconstruct the precise, dense, 3D, RGB-colored maps of surrounding environment in real-time (watch this [video](https://youtu.be/j5fT8NE5fdg)).
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/ziv-lin/r3live_dataset/blob/main/pics/cover_half.jpg" width = 98% />
<img src="https://github.com/ziv-lin/r3live_dataset/blob/main/pics/hku_campus_seq_01.png" width = 98% />

</div>

### 2.3 Ready for 3D applications
To make R3LIVE more extensible, we also provide a series of offline utilities for reconstructing and texturing meshes, which further reduce the gap between R3LIVE and various 3D applications (watch this [video](https://youtu.be/4rjrrLgL3nk)).

## 3. Prerequisites
### 3.1 **ROS**
Following this [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) to install ROS and its additional pacakge:<br>
```
sudo apt-get install ros-XXX-cv-bridge ros-XXX-tf ros-XXX-message-filters ros-XXX-image-transport ros-XXX-image-transport*
```
**NOTICE:** remember to replace "XXX" on above command as your ROS distributions, for example, if your use ROS-kinetic, the command should be:<br>
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-cv-bridge ros-kinetic-tf ros-kinetic-message-filters ros-kinetic-image-transport*
```
### 3.2. **livox_ros_driver**
Follow this [livox_ros_driver Installation](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver).

### 3.3 **CGAL** and **pcl_viewer** (optional)
```
sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev pcl-tools
```
### 3.4 **OpenCV >= 3.3**
You can use the following command to check your OpenCV version, **if your openCV version lower than OpenCV-3.3**, we recommend you to update your you openCV version if you meet errors in complying our codes. Otherwise, skip this step ^_^
```
pkg-config --modversion opencv
```
We have successfully test our algorithm with version **3.3.1**, **3.4.16**, **4.2.1** and **4.5.3**.

**Notice:** We have noticed that a large number of users meet a crash of problem after launching our package due to the mismatch of openCV version (see  [issue #11](https://github.com/hku-mars/r3live/issues/11), [issue #20](https://github.com/hku-mars/r3live/issues/20) and [issue #23](https://github.com/hku-mars/r3live/issues/23), and etc.). If you meet with similar problems, please make sure that the OpenCV you complied are same as the OpenCV you run with.  This is **very very** important to launch R3LIVE correctly.

## 4. Build R3LIVE on ROS:
Clone this repository and catkin_make:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/hku-mars/r3live.git
cd ../
catkin_make
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

## 5. Run our examples
### 5.1 Download our rosbag files ([r3live_dataset](https://github.com/ziv-lin/r3live_dataset)) 
Our datasets for evaluation can be download from our [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15i-TRa0EA8BCbNdARVqPMDsU9JOlagVF?usp=sharing) or [Baidu-NetDisk [百度网盘]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zmVxkcwOSul8oTBwaHfuFg) (code提取码: wwxw). We have released totally **9** rosbag files for evaluating r3live, with the introduction of these datasets can be found on this [page](https://github.com/ziv-lin/r3live_dataset).

### 5.2 Run our examples
After you have downloaded our bag files, you can now run our example ^_^
```
roslaunch r3live r3live_bag.launch
rosbag play YOUR_DOWNLOADED.bag
```
If everything is correct, you will get the result that matches our [paper](https://github.com/hku-mars/r3live/blob/master/papers/R3LIVE:%20A%20Robust%2C%20Real-time%2C%20RGB-colored%2C%20LiDAR-Inertial-Visual%20tightly-coupled%20stateEstimation%20and%20mapping%20package.pdf) and the results posted on this [page](https://github.com/ziv-lin/r3live_dataset). 

### 5.3 Save the maps to your disk
R3LIVE allow you to save the maps you build at anytime you wanted. You just need to click on the "Control panel" and press 'S' or 's' key.
<div align="center">
<img src="./control_panel.png" alt="video" width="80%" />
</div>

### 5.3 Reconstruct and texture your mesh
After you have save your offline map on your disk (default save in directory: ${HOME}/r3live_output), you can launch our utility to reconstruct and texture your mesh.
```
roslaunch r3live r3live_reconstruct_mesh.launch
```

### 5.4 Visualize your saved maps.
As default, your offline map (and reconstructed mesh) will be saved in the directory **${HOME}/r3live_output**, you can open it with pcl_viewer (and [meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/)).

Install pcl_viewer and meshlab:
```
sudo apt-get install pcl-tools meshlab
```

Visualizing your offline point cloud maps (with suffix *.pcd):
```
cd ${HOME}/r3live_output
pcl_viewer rgb_pt.pcd
```

Visualizing your reconstructed mesh (with suffix *.ply):
```
cd ${HOME}/r3live_output
meshlab textured_mesh.ply
```

## 6. Sample and run your own data
### 6.1  Livox-ros-driver for R2/R3LIVE
Since the LiDAR data and IMU data published by the official Livox-ros-driver is with the timestamp of LiDAR (started from 0 in each recording), and the timestamp of the image is usually recorded with the timestamp of the operation system. To make them working under the same time-based, we modified the source code of Livox-ros-driver, which is available at [here](https://github.com/ziv-lin/livox_ros_driver_for_R2LIVE). We suggest you replace the official driver with it when sampling your own data for R3LIVE.
### 6.2  Sensor calibration
In order to launch R3LIVE on your own hardware setup, you need to have a carefully calibration of the extrinsic among LiDAR, Camera and IMU. We recommend you using the following repo to kindly calibrate your sensors:

[**livox_camera_calib**](https://github.com/hku-mars/livox_camera_calib): A robust, high accuracy extrinsic calibration tool between high resolution LiDAR (e.g. Livox) and camera in targetless environment. 

## 7. Support of the spinning LiDAR
Even though our proposed method is unrelated to what kind of LiDAR you used, it is impossible for us making R3LIVE compatible with all kinds of existing LiDARs. To launch R3LIVE with spinning LIDAR, it requires you to take some effort in modifying the source code of our LiDAR front-end (see [LiDAR_front_end.cpp](https://github.com/hku-mars/r3live/blob/master/r3live/src/loam/LiDAR_front_end.cpp)). Here we give an example to test our LIO-subsystem with an [Ouster-2 64 Line Spinning LIDAR](https://ouster.com/zh-cn/products/scanning-lidar/os2-sensor/).

###  7.1 Example-1: Ouster OS2-64
Download our recorded rosbag file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZoDWDOZOcZ0H6MBMEpGMRc1nueeqToc/view?usp=sharing).
```
roslaunch r3live r3live_bag_ouster.launch 
rosbag play ouster_example_for_LIO_test.bag 
```
Notice: We manually disable our VIO-subsystem due the missed of calibration files in this example.

Finally, we are still working on making R3LIVE compatible with more spinning LiDARs. More and more examples will be released in the future.

## 8. Access our open source hardware design
In order to facilitate our users in reproducing our work, we also make our hardware design public available, where you can download all of our CAD source files in [rxlive_handheld](https://github.com/ziv-lin/rxlive_handheld).
